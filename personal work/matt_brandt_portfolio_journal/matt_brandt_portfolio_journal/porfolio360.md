Weekly Reflections Week 1 - 4/25/15
I have done all of the necessary steps to prepare me for this semester for this class. It wasn't as hard as I thought to post a quick intro on google hangouts air. However, when I tried viewing my own video There must have been a lot of internet lag because it was playing with very poor quality and speed.

This week I was able to spend time to think about what app I would like to design to learn more about to benefit others and I was able to pick the one I was most inclined to do. I was very glad to receive output about my elevator pitch and it was very exciting to see others supporting my idea and even gave me some very good idea's of what I can include in it.


- May 9, 2015
 
I met with my group this week and it went over really well. I learned a lot from them and was able to understand what I need to do in the future weeks for this class. I was able to research my first topic and teach it to my group.


- May 16, 2015
 
This week was pretty busy, I had a triathalon I was training for and other tutoring assignments that took up most of the time, my group was very accommodating and they were flexible with my schedule, I learn sometimes that if you create time management schedule for myself even with as much limited time that I have, following the time management schedule really gives me the motivation to accomplish what is required of me for this week for this class. 


- May 23, 2015
 
Today I focused on getting ahead on my Topic and Resources. I've learned a lot on Java Collections and UML diagrams. This Monday our group is going to prepare a Hack-a-Thon where we are going to power through all of the topic and resources. I am excited because I love getting ahead and learning with my group.

- May 30, 2015
 
This week was a very productive week. We had successfully completed a few hack-a-thons during the week and I was able to complete many topic resources and I am going to be doing some personal teaching video's in the upcoming week


- Jun 6, 2015
 
This was a work intensive week regarding work and finding time to post video's. I was able to research some of the topics that I needed to work on still. I scheduling some extra time so that I can start pumping some personal teaching video's into my groups community.


- Jun 13, 2015
 
Today I learned that there are similarities between Java and C++. For instance, the way they run off of a main function and the way that their stacks are formed to run functions in order. I thought that making that comparison made me understand java just a tinsy bit more than I had before.

Reflection- This week has been pretty good. I had done some service to my fellow group member, I was helping him pack up because he is moving to another city for his job. I have researched some topics that I had already been researching and I am amazed how rereading it, I keep learning more about it. This week's schedule has been hard and next week will be hard as well because the first part of the week I will be in Utah doing 6 job interviews.



- Jun 27, 2015
 
I am very excited about my progress this week. I have been doing research at an accelerated pace and playing with a lot of topic code and I am going to be posting all of my topics on personal video's this week. I have a lot of time that I am able to focus for this week and I am going to be excited to see the fruits of my efforts by the end of next week.

- Jul 18, 2015
 
Busy week guys here are some of the topics that I did feel free to comment below for some questions I will be glad to help.
